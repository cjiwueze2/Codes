    "The CBOW and Skip-gram models consistently show high cosine similarity for terms closely associated in Shakespeare’s plays, capturing domain-specific context well. The GloVe model provides lower similarity scores, showing that it doesn't capture Shakespeare-specific associations due to its general-purpose English training data. This demonstrates that CBOW and Skip-gram are more effective for text trained on specific literature, while GloVe performs better with broader, general-context associations."

    "The CBOW and Skip-gram models capture conceptual relationships within Shakespeare’s texts effectively, showing clear thematic connections specific to the literature (e.g., \"Denmark + queen\" and \"Scotland + soldier + spirit\"). GloVe, while effective in representing broad, foundational relationships (e.g., gender and family structures), lacks the nuanced literary connections, such as specific settings or supernatural themes, that CBOW and Skip-gram capture due to their Shakespeare-focused training. This makes CBOW and Skip-gram more precise in analyzing literary text, while GloVe provides a more generalized semantic context."
